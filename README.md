# Unicorn_Project
DA (Data Analytics) with SQL, Spreadsheets and Tableau

💡 Motivation
This project marks my first step into the world of data-driven decision-making. As part of my data analytics training program, the Unicorn Project gives me the opportunity to put theory into practice. Here, I’ll demonstrate my ability to analyze data and extract valuable insights that drive decisions.

My goals for this project are to:

Apply the skills I’ve learned in SQL, spreadsheets, and Tableau.
Solve real-world challenges and uncover actionable insights.
Showcase critical thinking, problem-solving, and effective communication.
This project is a foundation for my professional journey in the data analytics field.

🎬 Project Overview
The project is divided into four main parts, combining the tools and techniques I’ve studied so far:

Data Exploration with SQL
Data Cleaning using Spreadsheets
Analysis and Insights using Tableau
Executive Summary and Presentation
🦄 Project Background
The e-commerce platform Unicorn represents the significant growth of online retail over the last two decades.

Scenario
Unicorn is a family-owned business run by two stakeholders who are deeply invested in its success. To expand their data analytics team, they provided me with a sample sales dataset from 2015 to 2018.

My task:

Data Cleaning and Analysis with Spreadsheets

Clean and analyze the data in a unified CSV file.
Identify trends and uncover insights using spreadsheet tools.
Exploratory Data Analysis in Tableau

Create an interactive Tableau dashboard to dynamically showcase findings.
Executive Summary and Presentation

Develop a one-pager summarizing key insights and recommendations.
Record a 5-minute video presentation of the results.
📁 Project Submission
The final submission includes:

Tableau Public Link
Video Recording of the presentation (up to 5 minutes)
One-Pager PDF Report with embedded links to:
The spreadsheet analysis file.
The presentation slides.
SQL queries (stored in Google Colab, Docs, or Notion).
🚀 Next Steps
This project is a great opportunity to apply and further develop my skills. The feedback I receive in the coming weeks will help me refine my analysis and presentation techniques, preparing me for future challenges in the data analytics world.
